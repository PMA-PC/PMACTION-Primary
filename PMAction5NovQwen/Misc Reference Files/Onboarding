Common Onboarding Screens in Top Mental Health, Wellness & Habit Improvement Apps (2025)
The attached image shows Calm's onboarding flow—one of the most studied and emulated patterns in the wellness app space. Based on extensive analysis of the top mental health, wellness, and habit improvement apps in 2025, there are six core onboarding screen types that appear consistently across the category.

1. Goal/Motivation Selection Screen
This is the most universal onboarding screen type, appearing in virtually every top wellness app. Users select why they're using the app from a predefined list.

Common Question Formats:

"What brings you to [App Name]?" (Calm)​

"What has brought you to Headspace?" (Headspace)​

"What are your goals?" (Balance)​

"What do you want to achieve?" (Fabulous)​

Typical Response Options Include:

Reduce stress / Reduce anxiety

Improve sleep / Better sleep

Build self-esteem / Increase happiness

Improve focus / Performance

Develop gratitude / Mindfulness

Manage depression or mood

Calm's onboarding (shown in your attached image) uses exactly this pattern with options like "Improve Performance," "Increase Happiness," "Build Self Esteem," "Reduce Anxiety," "Reduce Stress," "Develop Gratitude," and "Better Sleep."​

2. Current State/Mood Assessment Screen
The second most common screen asks users to self-report their current emotional or mental state, establishing a baseline and enabling personalization.

Common Question Formats:

"How have you been feeling lately?" (Calm—shown in your image)

"How are you feeling today?" (Wysa, Youper)​

"What's your current mood?" (Daylio, Bearable)​

Typical Response Options:

Good / Okay / Stressed / Sad / Indifferent

A 5-point emoji/smiley scale

Descriptive moods like "anxious," "calm," "overwhelmed"

Apps like Wysa start with this immediately to tailor AI chatbot responses, while Daylio built its entire UX around quick mood selection using a simple smiley system.​

3. Stress/Challenge Source Identification Screen
This screen identifies what's causing the user's struggles, enabling highly targeted content recommendations.

Common Question Formats:

"What's the biggest source of your stress or anxiety?" (Calm—shown in your image)

"What challenges are affecting your journey?" (Wysa)​

"What areas do you want support with?" (Finch)​

Typical Response Options:

Money / Work or school

Health / Relationships

Family responsibilities

Other reasons

This pattern allows apps like BetterHelp to match users with appropriate therapists, while Calm uses it to curate personalized content libraries.​

4. Experience Level Assessment Screen
Apps need to calibrate content difficulty and instruction style based on user familiarity.

Common Question Formats:

"How comfortable are you with meditation?" (Calm, Headspace)​

"Have you meditated before?" (Balance)​

"What's your experience level?" (Fabulous)​

This enables apps like Headspace to recommend appropriate session lengths and guide users toward beginner-friendly content first. Balance uses this to determine whether to include foundational instruction in personalized meditation plans.​

5. Time Preference/Scheduling Screen
Wellness apps recognize that habit formation depends on routine, so they ask when users want to engage.

Common Question Formats:

"When would you like to meditate?" (Headspace)​

"What time works best for daily check-ins?" (Wysa, Finch)​

"How much time can you spare daily?" (Wysa)​

"When do you want to build your morning routine?" (Fabulous)​

Habitify and similar habit trackers let users categorize habits by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), while Fabulous structures its entire program around morning, afternoon, and evening routines.​

6. Demographic/Personal Information Screen
Some apps collect basic demographic data to further personalize recommendations.

Common Questions:

Age (Balance, Noom)​​

Gender/identity (BetterHelp)​

Height/weight (Noom, fitness apps)​

Sleep patterns (Finch)​

Noom is notable for having one of the longest onboarding flows—96+ screens collecting extensive personal data before presenting a customized weight loss plan. BetterHelp uses demographic and preference questions across 7 distinct stages to match users with therapists.​​

Key Best Practices Observed
Keep it concise: Calm uses just 3 screens with a visible step indicator—goal selection, benefit highlight, and clean CTA. Headspace limits onboarding to three simple questions.​

Personalization drives retention: Apps that ask personalization questions see up to 5X better engagement and 80%+ completion rates. Calm's approach of customizing the home page and notification flows based on user objectives is considered industry-leading.​

Show value before asking for commitment: Calm delivers value immediately—its loading screen begins the calming experience before onboarding even starts. Fabulous creates psychological commitment by having users "check boxes" promising to complete morning routine goals.​

Use soft, calming visuals: Mental health apps consistently use soft color palettes (blues, purples, greens), generous whitespace, and soothing animations to reduce cognitive load and create emotional safety.​

Social proof integration: Both Calm and Noom strategically insert social proof screens mid-onboarding ("Join millions of users...") to motivate users through longer flows.​
